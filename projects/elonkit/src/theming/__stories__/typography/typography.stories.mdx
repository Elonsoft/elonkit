# Typography

#### Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.

Typography is a way of arranging type to make text legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.
Typography is based on the guidelines from the Material Design spec and is arranged into
typography levels. Each level has a font-size, line-height, font-weight ad letter-spacing.
Our design system uses extended typographic scale with additional `body` and `mini` fonts.

<Canvas>
  <Typography />
</Canvas>

## Usage

Import typography theming module.

```scss
@import '@elonsoft/elonkit/theming/typography';
```

Use default typography or define your own. Notice that levels are nested inside maps with number
keys - this is breakpoints. This way fonts can change depending on a screen size.

```scss
$es-theme: es-light-theme(
  (
    colors: $es-light-theme,
    typography: $es-typography
  )
);

// or

$es-theme: es-light-theme(
  (
    colors: $es-light-theme,
    typography: (
      0: (
        body-m: mat-typography-level(es-rem(16), es-rem(24)),
        body-s: mat-typography-level(es-rem(14), es-rem(20)),
        // ...
      ),
      600: (
        body-m: mat-typography-level(es-rem(18), es-rem(26)),
        body-s: mat-typography-level(es-rem(16), es-rem(22)),
        // ...
      )
    )
  )
);
```

Include typography mixin.

```scss
@include es-typography($es-theme);
```

Now you can add the appropriate CSS classes to the elements that you want to style.
For a full list of default classes refer to a table above.

```html
<h1 class="es-h1">Heading</h1>
```
